MVC is an acronym for Model-View-Controller. It is a design pattern for software projects. It is used majorly by Node developers and by C#, Ruby, PHP framework users too. In MVC pattern, application and its development are divided into three interconnected parts. The advantage of this is it helps in focusing on a specific part of the application name, the ways information is presented to and accepted from, the user. It helps in allowing for efficient code reuse and the parallel development of the application.

Model: Model represents the structure of data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored. It maintains the data of the application. Essentially, it is the database part of the application.
